The content of the Testing part of the DJANGO tutorial series is not required this semester and it will not be assessed in Assignment 3. I include it here because I think it is an important topic but there is only a certain amount of time in any given semester and I didn't have enough class time available to go into this topic in detail. If you're planning a career as a developer however, I encourage you to spend some time perusing through this notebook.
