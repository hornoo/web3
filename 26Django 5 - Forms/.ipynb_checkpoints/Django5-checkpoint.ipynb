So far you have been using Django's generic admin tool which is not customized to your specific application. With Django forms we will be able to design a customized interface for our application to add and edit data to our database. We can either define one from scratch or create a ModelForm which will save the result of the form to the model. So let’s begin by creating a form for our Post model. Forms have their own file *forms.py*. Hence we need to create a file with this name in the blog application directory."
