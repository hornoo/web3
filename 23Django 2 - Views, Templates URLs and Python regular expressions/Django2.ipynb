Writing separate views for all the post numbers would be really inefficient. With regular expressions we can create a pattern that will match the URL and extract the number for us. For instance, the pattern ^post/(\\d+)/$ matches the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "- ^post/ is telling Django to take anything that has post/ at the beginning of the url path (right after ^)\n",
