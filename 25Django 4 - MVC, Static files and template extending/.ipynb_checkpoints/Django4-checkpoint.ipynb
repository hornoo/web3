This will be used to match against the HTTP request. In this example, in the first call of the url function, we're using ^$, so we're matching against the empty string or a visit to the domain with nothing after it (http://yourdomain.com/).\n",

In this example, if someone goes to http://yourdomain.com/ with nothing else in the URL (no file path), Django will call the post_list view. Lastly, the urlpatterns takes a name parameter at the end. This is what we used in our template before to refer to a specific URL. \n",
    "\n",
    "The procedure that Django uses when responding to HTTP requests is that it looks at urlpatterns and begins at the top to determine if the first one matches. If there's a match, it will call the associated view, otherwise it will continue into the next pattern. In this case, if the URL is /post/1/ then it will go to the post_detail view, otherwise, it will go to the next pattern.\n",

The \\d also tells us that it can only be a digit, not a letter (so everything between 0 and 9). + means that there needs to be one or more digits there. So something like http://127.0.0.1:8000/post// is not valid, but http://127.0.0.1:8000/post/1234567890/ is perfectly ok!\n",
